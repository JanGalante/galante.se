						Goal
						<br>
						
						<br>
						                     “To change or not to change”
						<br>
						
						<br>
						                            that is the question?
						<br>
						
						<br>
						                         Or should we rather say
						<br>
						
						<br>
						                           “change or perish”!!!!!
						<br>
						
						<br>
						How many systems do the software engineers start building from scratch today? Well, not many.  How many systems do the software engineers support today? The majority. Therefore, the success of many software organisations will strongly depend on how well they may support (evolve and maintain) these systems. And YOUR SUCCESS will strongly depend on how well prepared you will be to face the evolution and maintenance challenge. 
						<br>
						
						<br>
						So, take the opportunity and learn how to meet this challenge on the “Software Evolution and Maintenance” course. I promise you will not regret it. First of all, it is a very interesting course. After the first lecture you will become as deliriously enthusiasic as the course leader is.  Second of all, it is one of the unique courses in the world. It is even internationally listed among the very few courses on the subject in the world (see http://catamaran.labs.cs.uu.nl/twiki/pt/bin/view/Transform/TeachingSoftwareEvolution).  
						<br>
						
						<br>
						  
						<br>
						
						<br>
						General Description of Software Evolution and Maintenance 
						<br>
						
						<br>
						Software evolution and maintenance has become one of the most important, costly and complex activities within software engineering. Its cost reaches almost 90% of the total life-cycle cost. Evolution and maintenance encompasses enhancement of extant software systems with new functionality, attendance to software defects, adaptation to new environment, and prevention of future problems. 
						<br>
						
						<br>
						Despite the fact that evolution and maintenance has become the dominating software engineering activity, most of the academic courses today are only dedicated to software development, the phase before the system is delivered to the customer.  On this course, you will learn how to effectively evolve and maintain the software systems after the systems   is delivered to the customer. 
						<br>
						
						<br>
						Goal
						<br>
						
						<br>
						The primary goal of the course  is to provide students with basic knowledge about the domain of evolution and maintenance, its process models, and increase their awareness of the problems encountered both within the academia and industry.

						The history and future of the course
						<br>
						*****************************
						<br>
						
						<br>
						1999/2000: 
						<br>
						---------------
						<br>
						
						<br>
						The course was conducted for the first time in 1999. Please observe that at this time, there was hardly any course material. We used one book dealing  with the subject on a very general level. For this reason, the course leader got support from industry. Three industrial organisations were involved in teaching on the course. They were ABB Robotics, ABB Corporate Research and Neotech. The course mainly dealt with definition of the domain, maintenance categories, industrial processes in general, maturity model and predelivery and transition phases. 
						<br>
						
						<br>
						- Examination 1999/2000: The written examination was based on Pigoskis book - Practical Software Maintenance. This year, we hardly had any material to examine our students on. 
						<br>
						- Research task 1999/2000: The students evaluated the CMM from the perspective of software evolution and maintenance.
						<br>
						
						<br>
						
						<br>
						**********************************
						<br>
						
						<br>
						2000/2001: 
						<br>
						---------------
						<br>
						
						<br>
						The course was further extended with preventive maintenance, problem management and introduction to documentation process. 
						<br>
						
						<br>
						- Examination 2000/2001: The theoretical part was based on Pigoskis book - Practical Software Maintenance.
						<br>
						- Research task 2000/2001: The lecturer has defined a model encompassing a number of basic requirements for a documentation process. The students would first study the model and its requirements and then investigate how these requirements were implemented within the industry. This course task has resulted in an international publication presented at IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance 2001 in Florens in Italy. All the students involved on the course became co-authors of this international publication. 
						<br>

						<br>
						***********************************
						<br>
						
						<br>
						2001/2002
						<br>
						--------------
						<br>
						
						<br>
						The course was further extended with the documentation process, education and training and introduction to support processes. 
						<br>
						
						<br>
						- Examination 2001/2002: The theoretical part was based on Pigoskis book -Practical Software Maintenance and some of the lecturers own  international publications. This year  the students were examined against a set of predefined questions, listed in a Question Bank.
						<br>
						- Research task 2001/2002: The lecturer defined a maturity model for a front-end support process. The students studied the model and then investigated how it was implemented within the Swedish industry. It was really fun to see how the process was performed within the industry. 
						<br>
						
						<br>
						****************************************
						<br>
						
						<br>
						2002/2003
						<br>
						--------------
						<br>
						
						<br>
						The course material was extended with a testing process. All the couse material was written by the course leader, and it was delivered to students in form of a compendium. 
						<br>
						
						<br>
						- Examination 2002/2003: The theoretical part was based on a compendium, written by the course leader, and exclusively tailored for this course. Questions taken from the Question Bank were used in the written examination. .  
						<br>
						- Course task 2002/2003: The lecturer defined a set of basic requirements for either a testing process or a maintainability model of requirement specifications. The students investigated how these requirements are implemented within the Swedish industry.
						<br>
						
						<br>
						
						<br>
						*************************************
						<br>
						
						<br>
						2003/2004
						<br>
						---------
						<br>
						
						<br>
						The course was extended with enhancive maintenance process, maintainability and evolution and maintenance testing. The course was run in co-operation with Scandinavian Airline Systems (SAS). 
						<br>
						
						<br>
						- Examination 2003/2004: The theoretical part was based on the compendium and the question bank.  
						<br>
						
						<br>
						- Course task 2003/2004: Students conducted two types of tasks. Some groups conducted literature studies in various domains within evolution and maintenance. Three groups (4 members per group) conducted the course task at Scandinavian Airline Systems (SAS). They studied the evolution and maintenance of web services.
						<br>
						
						<br>
						****************************************
						<br>
						
						<br>
						2005/2006
						<br>
						---------
						<br>
						
						<br>
						The course compendium has been substantially improved. 
						<br>
						
						<br>
						- Examination 2005/2006: The theoretical part is based on the compendium and the Question Bank.  
						<br>
						
						<br>
						- Course task 2005/2006: Students will conduct two types of tasks. They will be free to choose whether they would like to make an industrial or literature study. The literature study will deal with reengineering and refactoring this year.
